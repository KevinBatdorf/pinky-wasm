# Pinky lexer, parser, and wasm code generator

I'm building this to apply what I'm learning of writing lexers, parsers, and code generators. I'll expand on this project over time.

Demo here [http://pinky.cool.omg.lol](http://pinky.cool.omg.lol).

If you want to learn more about this stuff, I highly recommend the [Compilers, Interpreters & Formal Languages](https://pikuma.com/courses/create-a-programming-language-compiler) course by [Pikuma](https://pikuma.com/). It's a beginner-friendly course that really goes into detail.

TODO:
- [ ] Add wasm code generation and render output
- [ ] Add lexer error recovery to continue tokenizing
- [ ] Add parser error recovery to continue parsing
- [ ] Show more detailed error messages and editor highlights
- [ ] Add a formatter to minimize/prettify the code
- [ ] Create a linter to check for common mistakes
