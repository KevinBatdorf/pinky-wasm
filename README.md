# Pinky Lang WebAssembly Compiler

### A lexer, parser, and WebAssembly (wasm) generator

I built this to apply what I'm learning of lexers, parsers, and code generators. And to practice writing WebAssembly at the bytecode level. Feedback and contributions are welcome, especially if you find bugs or want to point out something I'm doing wrong (or could do better).

Pinky is a simple scripting language that is designed for learning more about compilers and interpreters. It has a very simple syntax and is designed to be easy to understand. Read more about it at [https://pinky-lang.org/](https://pinky-lang.org/).

If you want to learn more about this stuff, I highly recommend the [Compilers, Interpreters & Formal Languages](https://pikuma.com/courses/create-a-programming-language-compiler) course by [Pikuma](https://pikuma.com/). It's a beginner-friendly course that really goes into much more detail than you would expect (or if you know Pikuma, you'd definitely expect this!).
